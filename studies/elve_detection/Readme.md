Elve Detection Analysis
=======================

The purpose of this set of simulations is to study the relationship between elve optical intensity and return stroke speed and peak current.

The script `run.m` submits a set of EMP runs, where the peak currents and return stroke speeds are swept over a range of values.

The script `analysis.py` reads the simulation outputs.
